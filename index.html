Part One: JavaScript and HTML Combine Forces

    Create a new repository, name it something along the lines of "javascript events playground", up to you

    Clone that repository to your projects folder

    Open up your repository in VSCode

    Create two files, index.html and index.js

    Create a script tag and link your index.html to your index.js:

    <script src="index.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>

    Now in your index.js file console.log a message and save the file

    Use live server to open your index.html file in your browser or use command: $ open index.html

    Open up the JavaScript Console. In Chrome shortcut is command + option + j
        you can access the Developer Console in Chrome by right clicking and selecting inspect
        also by using the top menu bar: View > Developer > JavaScript Console

    Do you see your message? Refresh the page to make sure your message appears!
        So what? We may have only made a console.log in the browser, but next we will use the connected files to access the Document Object Model
        If so give yourself a pat on the back, and move on to Part Two!

Part Two: The Return of the Document Object Model

Now we will have to work between the index.html and index.js file.

The goal is to create a button that will change the color of a square div

    In your index.html create a button tag and a div tag
        set the button type attribute to button
        use CSS or style tags to give the div a height and width of 250px and a border
        give the button an id of changeColor
        give the div an id of colorDiv
        you may also give your page a Header/Title
        you should have something that looks like this:
    [source: imgur.com]

    In your index.js file we will start accessing the DOM
        copy and paste this code into the index.js:

    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function(){

    })

        in those lines of code we are essentially telling the document: "wait until you're done loading, then run this code"
        we add an event listener using the addEventListener method of the DOM: document.addEventListener()
        we specify the 'DOMContentLoaded' event by adding a string of 'DOMContentLoaded' as the first argument of that method
        we use an anonymous function as the second argument of the addEventListener method
        move your console.log to within that function block

    Let's map out what we will do next using Psuedo Code

    select the "change color button" and store it in a variable named changeColorButton

    select the "change color div" and store it in a variable named colorDiv

    add a 'click' event listener to the changeColorButton

    within the 'click' event function block:

    change the background color of the div to green

    Now in JavaScript:

    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function(){

      let changeColorButton = document.querySelector('#changeColor')

      let colorDiv = document.querySelector('#colorDiv')

      changeColorButton.addEventListener('click', function(){

          colorDiv.style.background = 'green'

      })

    })

        Did the div change color? Woo hoo! But wait! There's more...
        Since we stored the colorDiv in a variable, we are able to access the attributes of that div using JavaScript.
        In this case we accessed the style attribute and then the background and set it equal to green!
        You can do much more than change colors of HTML elements of course, you can create HTML elements with JavaScript, you can add a class to an HTML element or change it's innerHTML
        Check out the Core Interfaces of the DOM from MDN

    Challenge: add an if else statement that will toggle color between green and white

    BONUS: add a mouseover event listener on the changeColor div that will change the background to another color besides green, go crazy!

    BONUS instead of using an anonymous function try adding your logic to a named function, and pass that function as the second argument of the DOMContentLoaded event listener

    But wait... there is another way
        add this code to the index.js file, this time we'll change the color to red
        we create a named function called changeColor and will assign it to the onclick attribute of another button

    function changeColor(){

    	let colorDiv = document.querySelector('#colorDiv')

    	colorDiv.style.background = 'red'

    }

    Now add another button element to your index.html and give it an onclick attribute and set the value of that attribute to changeColor()
        by giving the onclick attribute a value of changeColor() we are letting that button know, when clicked, run the changeColor() function
        2 different ways to make this happen, knowledge is power!

Great Work! You've completed JavaScript 101
